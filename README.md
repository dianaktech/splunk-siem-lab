<h1>ðŸ“Š Splunk Dashboards for GitHub Data Analysis </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves analyzing GitHub data to gain insights into various activities and trends,
visualized through interactive Splunk dashboards. Using real-time logs and event data, 
I designed a set of dashboards to monitor GitHub events, such as user activity, commit frequency, and more.
<br />


<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>

- <b>Splunk Enterprise </b> 
- <b>Dataset source: BOTSv3 GitHub </b> 
- <b> SPL </b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

 <b>Windows 11 </b>  

 <h2>Key Features</h2>

- <b>Collected data through GitHub logs and ingested it into Splunk.</b>
- <b> Used Splunkâ€™s Field Extractor to parse and extract key fields.</b>
- <b> Wrote SPL queries to filter, aggregate, and display data points.</b>
- <b>Created Dashboards with (bar charts, time series graphs, pie charts) to monitor and analyze  data trends.</b>
- <b> Integrated multiple visualizations into dashboards that provide  insights into the activity of the repositories.s</b>

<h2>Skills Demostrated:</h2>

- <b>Correlating multiple data points from different events to gain more meaningful insights.</b>
- <b> Fine tuning SPL queries</b>
- <b>Extracting useful information from raw GitHub data and ensuring that all fields were accurately parsed</b>
